🎯 The Problem
In today's digital landscape, retail investors and general users are prime targets for sophisticated financial scams. These threats—from "pump and dump" schemes on messaging apps to phishing attacks on social media—are increasingly multi-modal, using a combination of manipulative text, deceptive images, and malicious links. Traditional security tools, which rely on static blocklists and simple keyword matching, are no longer sufficient to protect users from these evolving, context-aware threats.

✨ Our Solution: Aegis Protocol
Aegis Protocol is a next-generation security agent that acts as an intelligent co-pilot for your browser. It goes beyond traditional methods by using a powerful Agentic AI Core to understand the nuance, context, and intent behind the content you see.

It proactively analyzes text, images, and links in real-time to identify manipulative tactics and potential fraud. When a threat is detected, Aegis provides an immediate, clear, and actionable warning directly at the point of interaction, empowering you to navigate the digital world safely.

🚀 Key Features
🧠 Agentic Reasoning Core: Employs a multi-agent AI system to understand context, reason about deceptive tactics, and determine threat levels with high accuracy.

⚡ High-Speed Semantic Caching: Utilizes a vector database to instantly flag known scams and their variations, reserving expensive deep analysis for truly novel threats.

👁️ Real-time Multi-Modal Analysis: Simultaneously analyzes:

Text: For manipulative language, urgency, and impersonation.

Images: For embedded text (via OCR) and known scam visuals (via Perceptual Hashing).

Links: For malicious destinations, checked against real-time threat intelligence feeds.

🌐 Platform-Agnostic: Provides seamless protection across web pages, social media feeds, and web-based messaging apps like WhatsApp and Telegram.

🤝 Crowdsourced Feedback Loop: Allows users to confirm threats, creating a powerful network effect where the system's intelligence and speed improve for all users.

🏗️ Architecture Overview
The system is built on a scalable, three-layer architecture designed for maximum efficiency and power.

Client-Side (Browser Extension): A lightweight agent that lives in the user's browser. It uses a DOM Distillation Engine to intelligently extract relevant content and manages the user interface for displaying warnings.

Backend (Cloud Infrastructure): A set of powerful microservices that perform the heavy lifting. This includes the Agentic AI Core, specialized analysis services for text/images/links, and the semantic cache query engine.

Data Layer (Databases): A collection of specialized databases, including a Vector DB for semantic caching, a Relational DB for structured threat intelligence, and a Key-Value Store for high-speed lookups.
